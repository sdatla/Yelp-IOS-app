(Debugging AutoLayout was a time sink)

Completed user stories:

Search Results Page:
Required: Search bar should be in the navigation bar.

Filter Page:
Required: User sees filters for category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
Required: The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
Required: Radius filter should expand as in the real Yelp app.
Required: Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand.
Required: Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page. 

Partially/Not complete: 
-trigger the search w/ the new filter settings. Currently user has to press the 'Search' button to trigger the search
-Deals switch not implemented yet
-Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
-Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
